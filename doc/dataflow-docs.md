Dataflow Docw
===

_The following is a rough template to use to help capture helpful documentation on this application, in particular, dataflow decisions that will effect upcoming infrastructure work. Eventually informs & is informed by data infrastructure documented here: https://github.com/tulibraries/grittyOps ._
